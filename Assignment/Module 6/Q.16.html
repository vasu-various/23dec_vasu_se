        <h2>Q.16 How are active links different from normal links?</h2>
        
            <ul>
                <li>Active links and normal links refer to the same thing. Both terms are used to describe hyperlinks that can be clicked on to navigate to another web page, website or a specific section within a website.</li>
                <li>When a user clicks on a hyperlink, it is said to be "activated" or "activated link." This action triggers the browser to load the linked page or website. So, both active links and normal links serve the same purpose of allowing users to navigate through the internet. The term "active links" may be used to emphasize that the links are currently functioning or have some interactive feature, while "normal links" may simply refer to regular links without any added features or interactivity.</li>
