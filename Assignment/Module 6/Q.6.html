        <h2>Q.6 What is the ‘class’ attribute in HTML?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The "class" attribute is an HTML attribute that is used to assign one or more class names to an HTML element. It is used to define a class of elements with similar characteristics or styles, which can then be targeted and styled using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).</li>
            <li>The value of the "class" attribute is a space-separated list of class names, and each class name should be unique within the HTML document. By assigning a class name to an HTML element, you can apply styles to all elements with the same class name, using the CSS selector for that class.</li>
            <p>For example, consider the following HTML code:
                <br>
                < div class="box blue" >< /div> <br>
                < div class="box red">< /div> <br>
                < div class="box green">< /div>
    
            </p>
            <li>In this example, all three < div> elements have the "box" class, and each one also has a unique class ("blue", "red", and "green", respectively). You could then use CSS to apply styles to all elements with the "box" class, or to target specific elements with the "blue", "red", or "green" class.</li>
        </ul>
