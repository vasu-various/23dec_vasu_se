    <h2>Q. 1 - Are the HTML tags and elements the same thing?</h2>
    
        <ul>
            <li> No, HTML tags and elements are not the same thing, although they are related. </li>
            <li>In HTML, a tag is a markup construct that specifies how content should be rendered on a web page. For example, the &lt;p&gt; tag indicates a paragraph of text, and the &lt;img&gt; tag indicates an image.</li>
            <li>An element, on the other hand, is made up of a start tag, some content, and an end tag. For example, a paragraph element would look like this:</li>
            <li style="color: yellow;">&lt;p&gt;<p>This is some text in a paragraph element.</p>&lt;/p&gt;</li>
            <li>Here, the &lt;p&gt; tag is the start tag, the text "This is some text in a paragraph element." is the content, and the &lt;/p&gt; tag is the end tag.</li>
            <li>So while tags are the individual building blocks of HTML, elements are the complete constructs that are made up of one or more tags and their content.</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Q. 2 - What are tags and attributes in HTML?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> In HTML, tags are used to define the structure and content of a web page. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets and typically come in pairs, with a starting tag and an ending tag. For example, the &lt;p&gt; tag is used to define a paragraph, and the text that is included between the &lt;p&gt; and &lt;/p&gt; tags is considered to be a part of that paragraph.</li>
        <li>Attributes, on the other hand, provide additional information about an HTML element. They are used to modify the behavior or appearance of a tag, and are included within the opening tag of an element. For example, the &lt;img&gt; tag is used to display an image on a web page, and it includes attributes such as "src" (which specifies the URL of the image file), "alt" (which provides a text description of the image for users who are visually impaired), and "width" and "height" (which specify the dimensions of the image).</li>
        <li>Attributes can also be used to provide links to other web pages or to specify formatting styles for text or other elements.</li>
        <p> Some common attributes include "href" (which specifies the URL of a hyperlink), "class" (which specifies a CSS class to be applied to an element), and "style" (which allows for inline styling of an element).</p>
    </ul>

    <h2>Q. 3 - What are void elements in HTML?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> In HTML, void elements are elements that do not have a closing tag. Instead, they are self-closing, and their end is indicated by a forward slash before the closing angle bracket of the opening tag.</li>
        <li>Void elements are used to insert various types of content into an HTML document, such as images, line breaks, input fields, and more. Examples of void elements include the "img" tag, the "br" tag, the "input" tag, the "meta" tag, and the "link" tag.</li><br>
        <li>Here is an example of a void element:</li>
        <p>&lt;img src="example.jpg" alt="An example image"&gt;</p>
    </ul>

    <h2>Q. 4 - What are HTML Entities?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> HTML entities are special codes that are used to represent characters that have a special meaning in HTML or that cannot be easily typed on a keyboard. They are used to ensure that these characters are displayed properly in web pages, regardless of the browser or device being used to view them.</li>
        <li>For example :</li> <p>the "<" character is used to start an HTML tag, so if you want to display a less-than symbol on a web page, you need to use the HTML entity "<" instead. Similarly, if you want to display a trademark symbol (™) or a copyright symbol (©), you can use the HTML entities "™" and "©", respectively.</p>
        <li>HTML entities are usually written using the "&" character, followed by a code or name that represents the character, and then ending with a semicolon (;). There are hundreds of HTML entities that represent different characters, including letters, numbers, symbols, and special characters.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Q.5 What are different types of lists in HTML?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ordered Lists: <br>
            Ordered lists are used when the list items need to be displayed in a specific order. In an ordered list, each list item is numbered. The tag used to create an ordered list is &lt;ol&gt;, and each list item is created using the &lt;li&gt; tag.&lt;/li&gt;
        <br> <p>Example:
            <ol>
                <li>Item 1</li>
                <li>Item 2</li>
                <li>Item 3</li>
              </ol>
              
        </p>
        <li>Unordered Lists: <br>
            Unordered lists are used when the order of the list items does not matter. In an unordered list, each list item is displayed with a bullet point. The tag used to create an unordered list is &lt;ul&gt;, and each list item is created using the &lt;li&gt; tag.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        <p>Example:
            <ul>
                <li>Item 1</li>
                <li>Item 2</li>
                <li>Item 3</li>
        </ul>              
        </p>
    </ul>
