Q. 4 - What are HTML Entities?

-> HTML entities are special codes that are used to represent characters that have a special meaning in HTML or that cannot be easily typed on a keyboard. They are used to ensure that these characters are displayed properly in web pages, regardless of the browser or device being used to view them.

For example, the "<" character is used to start an HTML tag, so if you want to display a less-than symbol on a web page, you need to use the HTML entity "<" instead. Similarly, if you want to display a trademark symbol (™) or a copyright symbol (©), you can use the HTML entities "™" and "©", respectively.

HTML entities are usually written using the "&" character, followed by a code or name that represents the character, and then ending with a semicolon (;). There are hundreds of HTML entities that represent different characters, including letters, numbers, symbols, and special characters.
