Q. 1 - Are the HTML tags and elements the same thing? 

-> No, HTML tags and elements are not the same thing, although they are related.

    In HTML, a tag is a markup construct that specifies how content should be rendered on a web page. For example, the <p> tag indicates a paragraph of text, and the <img> tag indicates an image.

    An element, on the other hand, is made up of a start tag, some content, and an end tag. For example, a paragraph element would look like this:

<p>This is some text in a paragraph element.</p>
Here, the <p> tag is the start tag, the text "This is some text in a paragraph element." is the content, and the </p> tag is the end tag.

    So while tags are the individual building blocks of HTML, elements are the complete constructs that are made up of one or more tags and their content.
