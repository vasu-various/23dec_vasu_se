A database is a collection of organized and structured data that is stored in a 
computer or other electronic device. It is designed to store, manage, and retrieve
large amounts of information efficiently and quickly. A database can be thought 
of as an electronic filing cabinet where data is stored in tables that are linked 
together.

Databases are commonly used to store and manage business, scientific, 
and personal data. They can be used for a variety of purposes, such as 
tracking inventory, managing customer information, storing financial records,
and analyzing scientific data. Databases can be either relational or 
non-relational, and they can be managed using a variety of software tools and 
programming languages.
