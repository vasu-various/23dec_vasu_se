What is Difference between DBMS and RDBMS?
->
    DBMS stands for Database Management System, while RDBMS stands for Relational 
Database Management System. The main difference between the two is that an RDBMS 
is a type of DBMS that is specifically designed to work with relational databases.

    Relational databases organize data into tables, which are composed of rows and 
columns. The columns represent the attributes of the data, while the rows 
represent the actual data values. In an RDBMS, tables can be related to one 
another through the use of foreign keys, which are used to create relationships 
between tables.

    A DBMS, on the other hand, is a general term that refers to any system that 
manages databases. This can include systems that work with non-relational 
databases, such as hierarchical or network databases, as well as systems 
that work with relational databases.

    In summary, all RDBMS are DBMS, but not all DBMS are RDBMS. An RDBMS is a 
specialized type of DBMS that is designed specifically to work with relational 
databases.
