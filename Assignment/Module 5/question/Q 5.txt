What do you understand By Data Redundancy?
->
    data redundancy refers to the duplication of data within a database. 
This occurs when the same data is stored in multiple places, often in 
different tables or files, within the same database.

    Data redundancy can be problematic for several reasons. Firstly, it can 
waste storage space, as multiple copies of the same data must be stored. 
Secondly, it can lead to inconsistencies in the data, as changes made to 
one copy of the data may not be reflected in other copies. This can result 
in data discrepancies and inaccuracies.

    In addition to these issues, data redundancy can also make it more difficult 
to maintain and update a database, as changes must be made to multiple copies 
of the same data. This can increase the likelihood of errors and make it more 
time-consuming to manage the database.

    To avoid data redundancy, DBMS designers aim to create normalized databases 
that adhere to certain rules and guidelines for organizing data. Normalization 
involves breaking down large tables into smaller, more specific tables, 
and establishing relationships between them to reduce redundancy and improve 
data integrity.
