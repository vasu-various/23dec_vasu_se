What is DML Compiler in SQL?
->
    DML (Data Manipulation Language) Compiler is responsible for translating data 
manipulation statements written in SQL into low-level instructions that can be 
executed by the database management system (DBMS).

    DML statements are used to insert, update, delete or retrieve data from a 
database. The DML compiler takes these statements and converts them into an 
executable format that can be used by the database engine to modify the data 
stored in the database.

    The DML Compiler is an important component of any DBMS, as it enables users 
to manipulate data in a database using a high-level language like SQL, rather 
than having to write low-level instructions directly. This makes it easier for 
developers to work with databases and ensures that data manipulation is carried 
out in a consistent and efficient manner.
