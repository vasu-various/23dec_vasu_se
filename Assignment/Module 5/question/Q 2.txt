What is Normalization? 
->
    Normalization is the process of organizing data in a relational database to 
reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves breaking down a database 
table into smaller, more manageable tables that are related to each other through 
common fields or keys. The objective of normalization is to eliminate data 
duplication and inconsistencies, and ensure that each piece of data is stored 
in only one place.

    Normalization is an important step in database design because it helps 
to ensure that data is accurate, consistent, and easy to manage. 
By breaking down large, complex tables into smaller, simpler ones, 
normalization helps to reduce data redundancy and improve data quality, 
which in turn makes it easier to maintain and update the database over time.
