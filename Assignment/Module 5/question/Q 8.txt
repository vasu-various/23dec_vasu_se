SQL key constraints are used to ensure the integrity of the data in a 
table by enforcing certain rules or requirements on the values that are 
stored in specific columns. There are several types of key constraints in 
SQL, including primary keys, foreign keys, unique keys, and check constraints.

Here is an example of a primary key constraint:
CREATE TABLE Customers (
   CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,
   FirstName VARCHAR(50),
   LastName VARCHAR(50),
   Email VARCHAR(100)
);
