What is trigger and how to create a Trigger in SQL? 
->
In SQL, a trigger is a special type of stored procedure that is automatically 
executed in response to certain database events, such as an insert, update, 
or delete operation on a table. The purpose of a trigger is to take some action 
or enforce some rule when a certain event occurs.

To create a trigger in SQL, you can use the following syntax:
CREATE [OR REPLACE] TRIGGER trigger_name
{BEFORE | AFTER} {INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE} [OF column_name]
ON table_name
[REFERENCING OLD AS old NEW AS new]
[FOR EACH ROW]
[WHEN (condition)]
BEGIN
-- trigger body goes here
END;
