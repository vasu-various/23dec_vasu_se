    <h1 class="Q">Q.16 How can a page be forced to load another page in JavaScript?</h1>
    <ul class="ans">
      <li>In JavaScript, you can use the window.location object to redirect the current page to a different URL, effectively loading another page.</li>
      <li>If you want to load a different page after a certain delay or in response to some event, you can use functions like setTimeout() or handle events accordingly. </li>
      <li>Remember that using JavaScript to forcefully redirect a user can potentially disrupt their experience, so make sure to use this technique responsibly and consider user experience.</li>
    </ul>
