    <h1 class="Q">Q.11 What are all the looping structures in JavaScript?</h1>
    <ul class="ans">
      <li>In JavaScript, there are several looping structures you can use to repeatedly execute a block of code. Here are the main looping structures:</li>
      <li>We have two type of looping structures 1. Entry control loop 2. Exit Control loop</li>
      <li style="color: red;">Entry control loops</li>
      <li>for loop: <br>
        The for loop allows you to specify an initialization, a condition, and an increment/decrement, and it repeatedly executes a block of code while the condition is true.</li>
    <li>while loop: <br>
        The while loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.</li>
    
    <li>for...in loop: <br>
        The for...in loop iterates over the enumerable properties of an object. It's primarily used for iterating over the keys of an object.</li>
        <li>for...of loop: <br>
            The for...of loop is used to iterate over the values of iterable objects (arrays, strings etc.) </li>
    <li>forEach loop: <br>
        The forEach method is available for arrays and is used to execute a provided function once for each array element.</li>
        <br>
        <li style="color: red;">Exit Control loop</li>
        <li>do...while loop: <br>
            The do...while loop is similar to the while loop, but it guarantees that the block of code is executed at least once before checking the condition.</li>
</ul>
