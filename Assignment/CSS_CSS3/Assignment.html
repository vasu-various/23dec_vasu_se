        <h2>Q.1 What are the benefits of using CSS?</h2>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a fundamental technology used in web development to control the presentation and layout of a web page. Here are some benefits of using CSS:</li>
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li>Separation of content and presentation: CSS enables web developers to separate the presentation of a web page from its content. This means that changes to the design or layout of a website can be made quickly and easily without having to change the underlying HTML code.</li>
                <li>Consistency and efficiency: By using CSS, web developers can create a consistent look and feel across an entire website, making it more efficient to maintain and update. CSS also allows for greater control over the formatting and styling of text and images, resulting in faster loading times and a better user experience.</li>
                <li>Flexibility and responsiveness: With CSS, web developers can create responsive designs that adjust to different screen sizes and devices. This makes it possible to create websites that are optimized for mobile devices and provide a seamless user experience across all platforms.</li>
                <li>Accessibility: CSS enables developers to create websites that are more accessible to users with disabilities. By separating the presentation of a web page from its content, developers can use CSS to create more readable and usable content for people with visual impairments or other disabilities.</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <li>Overall, CSS is a powerful tool for web developers that allows them to create more efficient, flexible, and accessible websites.</li>
        </ul>

            <h2>Q.2 What are the disadvantages of CSS? </h2><br>
            <ul>
                <li>While CSS is a powerful and widely used tool for styling web pages, it does have some disadvantages. Here are a few:</li>
                <br>
                <ol>
                    <li>Complexity: CSS can become quite complex, especially for large and complex websites. As styles are added, it can become difficult to manage and maintain the code.</li>
                    <li>Browser compatibility issues: Different browsers can interpret CSS in different ways, which can result in inconsistent rendering of web pages. This can make it difficult to ensure that a website looks the same across all platforms.</li>
                    <li>Learning curve: Learning CSS can be challenging, particularly for beginners. It requires an understanding of not just the language itself, but also of design principles and the ways in which different elements interact with each other.</li>
                    <li>Limited layout control: While CSS provides a great deal of control over the visual appearance of a web page, it can be limited in terms of layout control. For example, it can be difficult to create complex layouts that are flexible and responsive.</li>
                    <li>File size: Including large CSS files can increase the load time of a web page, which can negatively impact the user experience. This is particularly true for mobile devices and slower internet connections.</li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <li>Overall, while CSS is an essential tool for web design, it is not without its drawbacks, and designers must be aware of these limitations when using the language.</li>
            </ul>
