    <h1 class="Q">Q.16 What are the advantages and disadvantages of using external style sheets?</h1>
    <ul class="ans"> 
        <p class="ex">Advantages of using external style sheets:</p>
        <li> With external style sheets, you can define and control the styles for multiple web pages from a single file.</li>
        <li>If you need to make any style changes, you can update the external style sheet, and it will automatically apply those changes to all pages linked to it. </li>
        <li>This separation improves the maintainability of your code. </li>
        <br>
        <p class="ex">Disadvantages of using external style sheets:</p>
        <li> If the external style sheet fails to load due to network issues or incorrect file path, it can lead to the loss of styling for your web pages. </li>
        <li>External style sheets apply styles globally to all elements on a web page or across multiple pages. While this can be an advantage for maintaining consistency, it can also be a disadvantage if you need to apply specific styles to individual elements or pages. In such cases, inline or embedded styles may be more appropriate.</li>
        <li>If you have a small, simple website with just a few pages and minimal styling requirements, using an external style sheet may introduce unnecessary complexity. </li>
