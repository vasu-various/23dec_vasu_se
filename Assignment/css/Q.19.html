        <li>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) has a some set of rules that define how web pages are styled and presented. </li>
        <li>The rule set in CSS of selectors and declarations</li>
        <li>Selectors: Selectors determine which elements on a web page the CSS rules should be applied to. There are various types of selectors in CSS, including:</li>
        <li>Element selectors: Select elements based on their tag name, such as p, h1, or div.</li>
        <li>Class Selector: Targets elements with a specific class attribute value. It is select by (.) followed by the class name. For example, .my-class selects all elements with class="my-class".</li>
        <li>ID Selector: Targets an element with a specific ID attribute value. It is select by a hash symbol (#) followed by the ID name. For example, #my-id selects the element with id="my-id".</li>
        <li>Declarations: Declarations define the style properties and their values that should be applied to the selected elements. Each declaration consists of a property and a value separated by a colon (:). Multiple declarations are enclosed within curly braces ({}) </li>
